               <p>I got into coding and software development in 6th form in school in an extra curricular class. I then followed that into a degree as talked about below</p>
               <p>Outside of education, I spend a lot of my time volunteering. In the school term I am a Boys Brigade officer, helping young boys find their feet as they navigate school and help them in their faith.</p>
               <p>In the summer I also help with summer camps which offer young kids of primary school age somewhere to spend a week with games, food, song and praise. I have also been part of a team which went to Romania in 2019 to help build a school for vulnerable children</p>
               <p>I am a mega car nerd, I enjoying building and talking about cars, purchasing my own dream car in 2020 from Japan which I enjoy taking to shows with friends. I love football, and these two hobbies are what you will find me spending a lot of my free time outside of education on</p>

                <h5 class="indigo-text text-darken-4">Version 1 Belfast Full Stack Engineer Placement</h5>
                <p>In 2019 I had a 16 week placement at Version 1. I was a full stack engineer working in a team to make a bespoke estimating system to help consultants best estimate cost and time required to appropriately give estimates to customers. We worked in the .NET framework and did our own back end in SQL, front end with razer Views with jquery, javascript, html & css and used a c# logic base. To the best of my understanding, this has since been rolled out internally.</p>
                <h5 class="indigo-text text-darken-4">Civic and Economic Recovery Qualification</h5>
                <p>Albeit education, I consider this module as professional experience as it was an additional module (on top of required work) that I studied in 2020/21 with the intentions of best helping the individual understand the working world and the struggles they face and how to best implement in them, so I feel I have a better understanding of the industry as a result of this.</p>
